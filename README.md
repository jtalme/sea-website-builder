# sea-website-builder
Tutorial for helping 5th graders build a website to showcase their science
projects built as part of the curriculum at [SEA](http://sea.rdale.org/).

You can step through the tutorial [here](https://tallstak.github.io/sea-website-builder/).

This is built as a single page app using React router and deployed using
Github pages. Inspiration for the routing design came from
[this project](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).
